1. Add 2-qubit noise channels.
2. Nice to have: Support for a final readout of state (a measurement at the end of execution) - readout specified qubits, or all if not specified.
    Does not affect the regular measurement which can be performed during the run (e.g., in teleportaion), this one is in addition to it.
    Make sure there are no cases in examples and tests where qmeasure reads qubits into clbits not naturally aligned, e.g., qmeasure([0,1,2],[2,1,0]).
