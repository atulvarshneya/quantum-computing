# Qusimulator – A quantum computing simulator
## Release 2.3

`$ pip install qusimulator`

New feature added for multi-shot readout of the result of the quantum computation. Added qreadout(nshots) to readout the results after completing the computations by applying a series of gates. Supported on state-vector as well as density-matrix simulators.
