Quantum Computing Blog
</h1>

Welcome to a practitioner’s guide to quantum computing.

This blog is designed for curious computer scientists, software engineers, and technology enthusiasts who want to understand quantum computing from the inside out — not as abstract physics, but as something you can actually build, simulate, and experiment with. The focus here is hands-on and algorithm-centric: we will explore the most important quantum computing algorithms, unpack how and why they work, and implement them step by step using [Qucircuit](https://github.com/atulvarshneya/quantum-computing/blob/master/qucircuit/README.md), a full-featured quantum computing simulator that runs locally on your own machine. Along the way, a dedicated series of “Short Notes” will distill key concepts from quantum mechanics and quantum information into clear, practical explanations that strengthen your intuition without requiring a deep background in physics. If you enjoy learning by building, reasoning from first principles, and understanding systems at a conceptual level, this site is for you.
