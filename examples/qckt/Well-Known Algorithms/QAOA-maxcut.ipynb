    "# A Tutorial Introduction to QAOA\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents an instructive implementation of **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It walks you through the core concepts of the algorithm, and then an implementation for MAXCUT problem, a NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brief Description of QAOA algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/QAOA-Diagrams/VQA.PNG\" width=\"750\" height=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "QAOA is an instance of variational quantum algorithms (VQA). The key idea behind QAOA, like any VQA, begins with a parameterized quantum circuit, often called an *ansatz*. This circuit includes adjustable rotation angles or other tunable values that influence how the quantum state evolves. With these parameters set to some initial values, the circuit is executed on a quantum computer, which returns a set of measurement outcomes, usually bitstrings like 0101 or 1110. These bitstrings represent candidate solutions to the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, these solutions are evaluated by a classical computer using a cost function. This cost function depends on the problem; for instance, for the optimization problem MAXCUT, it computes the number of edges crossing a cut (see the description of the MAXCUT problem below). Using the cost function an expectation value of the cost is calculated, and is used to determine the loss which is the target to minimize.\n",
    "\n",
    "After scoring the results, a classical optimization algorithm updates the parameters of the quantum circuit. This could be a gradient-free optimizer like Nelder-Mead, COBYLA, or SPSA, all of which tolerate noisy measurements well. In this notebook we have used Nelder-Mead optimizer. The circuit is updated with these new parameter values, and the quantum computer is run again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This loop continues until the algorithm converges or reaches a stopping criterion. Over time, the quantum circuit becomes increasingly biased toward producing high-quality solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MAXCUT problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $G = (V,E)$ be an undirected graph, where $V$ is the set of vertices, and $E \\subseteq \\{(i,j) | i,j \\in V, i \\neq j\\}$, is the set of edges\n",
    "\n",
    "A cut is a partition of the vertex set into two disjoint subsets $𝑆$ and $S'$, such that $S \\cup S' = V$ and $S \\cap S' = \\varnothing$. The cost of a cut is the number of edges that span this partition - or are cut by this partition. The MAXCUT problem is to find a partition that maximizes the cost of the cut. \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure below shows an example MAXCUT for a graph drawn in two different ways.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/QAOA-Diagrams/MAXCUT-example.PNG\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "MAXCUT is NP-hard and serves as a canonical benchmark for combinatorial optimization algorithms, including QAOA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cut representation as a bitstring** Cut can be represented as a bitstring, where a bit position represents a vertex, and it value of 0 or 1 represents the set that vertex belongs to. In the example shown above, the cut can be represented as 11010 or 00101; vertex 0 being the least-significant bit and vertex 4 the most-significant bit."

    "Theoretically, the larger the number of layers in the circuit, the more accurate are the quantum circuit outputs. However, for large number of layers the loss function is very jagged, while for a single layer, it is quite smooth and sinusoidal-ish in shape. So, an approach that is sometimes followed is to start with a single layer circuit, and determine the optimal `gamma` and `beta` values for that. Next, use these gamma and beta values as starting ones for a circuit with 2 layers and find the optimal gamma and beta values for that sized circuit. Finally, these are used as the starting values for a circuit with 3 or 4 layers. Typically, this is sufficient, and no larger circuits are used.\n",
